# Danieo's Ant
## A JavaScript implementation of Langton's Ant.

The basic model was invented by Chris Langton in 1986. This is a sligthly modified implementation in JavaScript.
What's the difference?
* Finite map (Originally the map was infinite)
* Three states for a cell (The genuine model had only two states)
